    BUHBYE

    VISIBLE thing2 + thing6                 BTW Should print "Hello WorldPancit Canton\n"

    result3 R SUM OF QUOSHUNT OF PRODUKT OF int1 AN result2 AN result1 AN int2
    VISIBLE QUOSHUNT OF 0.32 AN int3        BTW should result into an error (div by zero)

    BTW testing string shits --------------------
    string1 R SMOOSH thing6 AN name AN "wowers" AN "\n" AN thing7

    BTW testing boolean shits -----------------
    bool1 R ALL OF NOT WIN AN BOTH OF WIN AN bool1 AN EITHER OF FAIL AN WIN MKAY
    VISIBLE bool1
    WON OF WIN AN thing
    bool2 ANY OF bool1 AN bool2 AN NOT EITHER OF WIN AN bool1 MKAY

    VISIBLE BOTH SAEM 3 AN 5
    VISIBLE DIFFRINT 4 AN 4

    BOTH SAEM 5 AN BIGGR OF 43 AN 2 
    BOTH SAEM -45 AN SMALLR OF -3 AN 0

    OBTW
    tpelk zpnuhsz ??????
    TLDR

    BTW typecasting

    BTW does not do anything, stores val to IT
    MAEK thing a TROOF
    MAKE thing4 a NUMBR

    thing4 IS NOW A NUMBR
    float2 R MAEK float2 NUMBAR BTW us2 q ma2log

    BOTH SAEM SUM OF 3 AN 2 AN 5
    O RLY?
        YA RLY
            VISIBLE "i can do math"
        NO WAI

    IM OUTTA YR print10

    OBTW
        TO-DO inaantok n kse aq
            - functions
            - test case na may errors
    TLDR

    BTW recursive factorial func, di ko alam if dapat isupport to HAHAHAHAAH
    HOW IZ I factorial YR n AN YR acc
        BOTH SAEM n AN 0
        O RLY?
            YA RLY
                FOUND YR acc
            NO WAI
                FOUND YR I IZ factorial YR DIFFRINT n AN 1 AN YR PRODUKT OF n AN acc

    IF U SAY SO

    BTW Wrapper function for tail recursion
    HOW IZ I factorial YR n
        I IZ factorial YR n AN YR 1
        VISIBLE "result: " + IT
    IF U SAY SO

KTHXBYE
BTW some comments after program
