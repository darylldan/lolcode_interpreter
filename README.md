## How to Run

### Requirements
- This interpreter is better suited on Windows as it clashes with native styles from macOS and linux.
- The intended resolution for the UI is `1366 * 768`.
- Dependencies
    - Python 3.12.1 (Project uses types and matchn cases)
    - Tkinter (For UI)

### Running
1. Open a terminal to the root directory of the project.
2. Run the `main.py` file using the command
    - For -NIX based systems:
        ```
        python3 main.py
        ```
    - For Windows:
        ```
        python main.py
        ```
